# Mad Harry's MIDI File Printer

# TODOs
* Convert manual to something like markdown or asciidoc
* Further simplify drawing layer, no color palettes any more, ...
* Visualize tempo changes, ritardandos, etc.
* Embed about-me picture in the program code
* Program icon is looking strange, default of wxWidgets?
* Problem with Umlauts in file names (when OS uses UTF-8 encoding)
* left/top windows positions not remembered, always = 0 (.MIDI_PRT.CFG and .MIDI_PRT.MI$) caused by Wayland, worked with X11
